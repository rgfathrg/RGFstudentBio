    <p>31, educated in criminology at West Virginia University and took my newly acquired
        skills to China to teach children how to speak the wonder language of English. From there 
        began a job carousel through gym membership sales, adminstrator at a self-defense gym, bank teller
        and financial operations. Where the carousel ends no one knows. My cure for the daily douldrums is travel, 
        eating out, reading a riveting story, and taking in the fresh air of good ole nature.
